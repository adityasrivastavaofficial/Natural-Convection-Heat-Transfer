# Natural Convection Heat Transfer Through Thin Hollow Pipe Suspended In Air

## Summary
Natural convection heat transfer in a hollow cylinder is analyzed through Ansys software
by varying the Rayleigh Number(Ra) in laminar order(104 ≤ Ra ≤ 108). The simulation is
carried out by varying the ratio of length to diameter (L/D) in the range of (1≤L/D≤20)
and inclination angle of the cylinder from 0 degree to 90 degree. The heat transfer was
found to depend on the diameter, inclination and Rayleigh’s number and general
equations representing this are suggested.
